<dt>Writing</dt>

 

<td> 
				A lot of people think you have to be a good writer to write. But, the truth is, as Langston Hughes once said, “The prerequisite to writing is having something to say".

 <br><br><br>

Whether you want to hone your skills in writing courses, writing groups, or just write alone, it can be a very meditative experience. Some ideas for what to write about include: personal stories, fictional stories, poetry, song lyrics, etc.

<dt>Reading</dt>

 
<dd>

Reading allows me to temporarily escape into a different world, and it doesn’t cost much, if anything at all. If I have access to a library, I can get books for free. I can also consider using an e-book and purchasing books for a lower cost than some hardcover books may cost. I can also read online in PDF form, share books with friends, or even start a book club where I can exchange books.

Thanks to technology, most people have access to cameras on their phones. If I don’t want to splurge on buying a professional camera, I can hone my skills on my mobile phone instead.

Additionally, there are apps and resources where I learn photo editing on either a computer or a phone.
